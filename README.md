# App-Cleaner-Icon-Set

## About
This is an alternate icon set of the [App Cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) application by [freemacsoft](https://freemacsoft.net). This icon set is designed to be compliant with modern macOS application icon design specifications introduced in macOS Big Sur. I've created this to make this application look more uniform on my system and I thought I'd share in case other's wanted it aswell.

## How To Add Icon
1. Navigate to the `/Applications` folder in macOS.
   - This can be done by pressing ⇧⌘A while finder is open.
2. Find the App Cleaner app.
3. Right click on the app and press `Show Package Contents`.
4. Navigate to `Contents/Resources/`.
5. Drag and drop `AppCleaner.icns` file provided in this repo into the `Resources` folder.
6. Click 'Replace' on the popup menu.
